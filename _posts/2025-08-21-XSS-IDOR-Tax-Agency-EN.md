## Introduction: Vulnerabilities in Critical Services

**Hello everyone!** Today we're going to analyze a concerning discovery: **multiple security vulnerabilities** in a government digital platform for fiscal services. During a security audit, I identified three critical vulnerabilities that affect the security and privacy of citizens.

### Discovery Context

The vulnerabilities were found in the **virtual assistant** and **document management** systems of a government entity, services used daily by citizens for administrative consultations and official documentation management.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 🚨 **Vulnerability 1: Reflected XSS in AsistenteController**

#### **Description**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the conversation parameter of the virtual assistant endpoint.

#### **Technical Details**
- **Affected endpoint**: `/path/to/assistant/controller`
- **Vulnerable parameter**: `conversationId`
- **Type**: Reflected XSS
- **Method**: POST

#### **Proof of Concept Payload**
```javascript
conversationId=test"><iframe src="javascript:alert(1)">
```

#### **Impact**
- **JavaScript execution** in the context of the official domain
- **Potential cookie theft** and session tokens
- **Unauthorized access** to sensitive user data
- **Page content modification**

### 🚨 **Vulnerability 2: Reflected XSS in DetallePDF**

#### **Description**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the `id` parameter of the document management endpoint.

#### **Technical Details**
- **Affected endpoint**: `/path/to/document/handler`
- **Vulnerable parameter**: `documentId`
- **Type**: Reflected XSS
- **Method**: GET

#### **Exploitation URL**
```
https://example-gov-site.com/path/to/document/handler?documentId=<iframe src="javascript:alert(1)"
```

#### **Impact**
Similar to the previous one, but with the additional advantage of being **exploitable via GET**, facilitating **phishing** and **social engineering** attacks.

### 🚨 **Vulnerability 3: IDOR - Unauthorized Access to Conversations**

#### **Description**
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) that allows access to **private conversations** of other users through ID parameter manipulation.

#### **Technical Details**
- **Affected endpoint**: `/path/to/document/handler`
- **Vulnerable parameter**: `documentId` (sequential IDs)
- **Type**: IDOR (Unauthorized Access)

#### **Exploitation Example**
```
https://example-gov-site.com/path/to/document/handler?documentId=[INCREMENTAL_ID]
```

#### **Exposed Data**
- **Full name** and **identification number** of citizens
- **Complete conversations** with the virtual assistant
- **Specific administrative consultations**
- **Date and time** of interactions
- **Sensitive data** related to official procedures

## Example of Exposed Data

### Compromised Personal Information

In controlled tests, access was gained to information such as:

```
ID: [ANONYMIZED_NUMBER]
Last Name and Name: [CENSORED_PERSONAL_DATA]
Query made on: [ANONYMIZED_DATE]

USER: How do taxes apply to educational products?
USER: Payment methods available for official forms
USER: Query about fiscal regulations for renovations
```

## Risks and Impact

### 🎯 **For Citizens**

#### **Privacy Violation**
- **Exposure of personal fiscal data**
- **Unauthorized access** to tax consultations
- **Revelation of sensitive economic** information

#### **Security Risks**
- **Identity theft** through Tax ID and personal data
- **Social engineering** using real tax information
- **Targeted tax fraud** based on obtained data

### 🏛️ **For the Administration**
- **Loss of citizen trust**
- **Data protection regulation non-compliance**
- **Potential sanctions** from regulatory bodies
- **Compromise of internal systems**



## Mitigation Recommendations

### 🛡️ **Key Recommendations**

#### **For the Organization**
- **Strict validation** of input parameters
- **Escaping of special characters**
- **Implementation of robust CSP**
- **Authorization verification** on endpoints
- **Anti-CSRF tokens**

```php
// Mitigation example
$id = htmlspecialchars($_POST['id'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
if (!isAuthorized($userId, $docId)) return error403();
```

#### **For Citizens**
- **Review URLs** before clicking
- **Log out** after use
- **Monitor personal** access

## Conclusions

This case demonstrates the importance of:
- **Regular audits** in public services
- **Security training** for developers
- **Robust review processes**

Security in digital public services **is non-negotiable**. It's the administrations' responsibility to guarantee the **highest security standards**.
